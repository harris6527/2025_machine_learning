### Evaluation as a Grader

From my perspective as a grader for this Week 5 assignment (based on the provided prompt in "SCMA30019 - Week 5 AS - HackMD.pdf"), your submission in "week5 assignment.md" is generally strong and demonstrates a good understanding of the technical material. The proofs and derivations for parts 1 and 2 are clear, well-structured, and mathematically correct—they align closely with standard results in multivariate statistics and matrix calculus. You've used appropriate notation, shown key steps, and even included helpful notes (e.g., the distinction between MLE and unbiased covariance in 2(c)). This would earn full or near-full credit for those sections.

However, there are a few areas that could benefit from modification or clarification to better align with the assignment expectations, improve readability, or enhance academic integrity. I'll break it down by section, focusing on what's solid and what might need tweaks. Overall, this is a minor revision candidate rather than a major overhaul—perhaps a score of 85-90/100 as is, depending on the rubric weighting.

#### 1. Multivariate Normal PDF Integrates to 1
- **Strengths**: The proof is complete and elegant. You correctly used the change of variables with the matrix square root, handled the determinant in the Jacobian, and factored the integral into a product of univariate Gaussians. The final result is clearly shown.
- **Needs Modification?** No significant issues here. Minor suggestion: Ensure consistent notation for the determinant (you used \lvert \Sigma \rvert and \det(\Sigma) interchangeably—pick one for uniformity). This is nitpicky and wouldn't deduct points.

#### 2. Matrix Calculus / Trace Identities
- **Strengths**:
  - (a): Solid use of differentials and Frobenius inner product to derive the gradient. Correct result (B^T).
  - (b): Clear demonstration of the trace equivalence for the quadratic form, with multiple equivalent expressions shown.
  - (c): Thorough derivation of MLEs for μ and Σ, including the log-likelihood, score equations, and matrix derivatives. You correctly noted the 1/n factor for the MLE vs. unbiased estimator—nice touch.
- **Needs Modification?** Minimal. The labeling is fine (you called the MLE part (c), even though the prompt has a duplicate (b)—this shows good initiative). One small thing: In (c), you used \partial \log\det(\Sigma)/\partial\Sigma = (\Sigma^{-1})^\top, which is correct, but briefly justify why the transpose appears (e.g., since Σ is symmetric). Again, not a big deal.

#### 3. Unanswered Questions
- **Strengths**: You've provided a detailed list of questions, which shows engagement with broader course themes like ML evaluation, experimental design, and project application. Many of these (e.g., on time series splitting, robustness tests, metrics like AUC/F1/RMSE, reproducibility) are relevant to machine learning practices covered in the course.
- **Needs Modification?** Yes, this section could use some refinement to better match the prompt's intent. The assignment asks you to "think about these questions" (referring to unanswered ones from the lecture) and "write down the ones you find important, confusing, or interesting... just state them clearly." Your list appears to be a direct copy-paste of a student's message (starting with "老師好～" and including skipped numbers like missing 5, 11, 12), which feels more like quoting an external source rather than your own reflection.
  - **Suggestions for Modification**:
    - Rephrase as your personal questions: Instead of framing it as a message to the teacher, list them as bullet points in your own words (e.g., "What is the recommended supervision target for time series data: classification, regression, or sequence prediction?"). This makes it clear it's your thinking process.
    - Translate to English: The rest of your submission and the assignment prompt are in English, so switch the questions to English for consistency. If the course allows bilingual submissions, this might be optional, but it improves accessibility.
    - Tie back to lecture content: The prompt implies questions related to Week 5 topics (e.g., multivariate Gaussians, MLE, matrix derivatives). Your list focuses on final project logistics/ML best practices in finance, which is fine if these were discussed in lecture, but add 1-2 questions directly from the technical material (e.g., "How does the assumption of positive definiteness for Σ affect MLE stability?" or "Why use traces in matrix calculus for quadratic forms?"). This shows deeper engagement with the week's content.
    - Fix numbering: The skips (e.g., from 4 to 6) look like a copy error—renumber sequentially.
  - **Why Modify?** Without these changes, it might seem like low-effort or not fully original, potentially violating the academic integrity reminder (e.g., if this is copied from a forum/email without attribution). Aim for 3-5 thoughtful questions rather than 15 to keep it focused.

#### General Submission Aspects
- **Format and Readability**: The Markdown format is clean and appropriate. Math renders well with LaTeX. No issues with clarity.
- **Policy Compliance**: Everything seems original for parts 1-2 (standard proofs, but derived step-by-step). For part 3, as noted, ensure it's your own work— if this list is from elsewhere, cite it or reword.
- **Overall Recommendation**: Submit a revised version with updates to part 3. This would push it to full credit. If time is short, it's still passable as is, but the modifications would demonstrate stronger critical thinking.

If you revise based on this feedback, feel free to resubmit or ask for clarification! Keep up the good work—the technical depth is impressive.
